Web Dev portfolio for my final MTM6201 project

## Introduction
This portfolio showcases some of my skills and creativity as a web developer and designer. I show a range of projects that demostrates my skills in web tech and my approach to user-centered design.

## Design

The design of this project was created using Figma during my UX course. You can view the design mockups and prototypes here:

## Process
The development of my portfolio has been an iterative process. Beginning with sketches and mockups, I transitioned through design, development using  Figma for this wireframes and mockups, and testing phases, constantly cleaning my work. My workflow was flexible yet structured, allowing room for creative exploration while sticking to best practices in web dev.

## Challenges and Solutions
During development, I encountered several challenges:
- Adapting mockup designs to actual code proved to be a balancing act between aesthetic appeal and practicality.
- Achieving responsive design across various devices required meticulous CSS adjustments and testing.
- Implementing certain interactions demanded researching and learning new coding techniques.

Each challenge was met with a determination to find solutions, often leading to learning new approaches and optimization methods. This problem-solving aspect turned out to be a rewarding process, pushing me to expand my knowledge and skills.

## Lessons Learned
The creation of my web portfolio has been a significant learning journey. Reminding me the importance of adaptability in development and design. I have gained deeper insights into:

- The significance of UX and the impact of design decisions on usability.
- The need for code readability and maintainability for future updates.
- The power of community resources when troubleshooting complex issues.

I have also recognized an interest in expanding my linguistic toolkit and plan to explore new programming languages that could improve my development capabilities.

# Differences from Prototype

During the development process, some changes were made from the original design prototype. These changes were implemented based on user feedback, accessibility considerations, and design improvements.

1. **Copyright Font Size**: Increased to improve readability, as suggested by WAVE tool analysis.
2. **Contact Information Underline**: Initially, contact information is presented without an underline to maintain a clean aesthetic. The underline appears on hover to signal interactivity, in line with accessibility guidelines.
3. **Work Gallery Stickers**: Stickers within the work cards are constrained to fit within the card dimensions, ensuring a neat presentation.
4. **Work Gallery Overlay**: A stronger blur effect has been applied to the overlay to improve text contrast and address potential visibility issues.
5. **Process Cards**: Adjusted the font used for numbering and modified content sizing and style to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
6. **Services Page Omission**: The services page and the concept of starting prices were removed following negative feedback. It was determined that a more customized approach to service offerings would be more suitable.
7. **About Page Adjustments**: The carousel on the about page now includes animations, and an image depicting achievements has been removed based on user research feedback.

These changes are part of my ongoing effort to improve user experience and ensure that the website meets the standards of design and accessibility.
